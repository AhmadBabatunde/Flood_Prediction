<p>This model was part of a kaggle compitition</p>
<h3>Technique</h3>
<p>Several technique was implement in an effort to improve the accuracy of the model. I implement the <strong>Linear Regression</strong>, <strong>Polynomial Regression</strong>, <strong>Random Forest</strong> but the polynomial seems to be the most effect at degree 2 i was abel to get a <strong>0.845</strong> accuracy.
